# MIK_2019
Modified Inverse Kirkendall (MIK) Code

Version 08/2019, S.M. Levine:
Using the GFortran compiler (https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran) with the correct working directory setup, the makefile can be run and will output a "mik.exe" file. That file can then be executed to get an output file ("perks.out").
